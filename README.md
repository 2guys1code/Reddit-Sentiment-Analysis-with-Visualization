# Reddit-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Visualization

## What it does

This program extracts user posts submitted on the social media plattform Reddit. After it pulls the data, a sentiment analysis using flair 
determines the sentiment score of the individual posts. The results are stored in .csv-Files locally and a graphical illustration is shown to the user. 

Furthermore, the program lets the user select the search term, the subbreddit (s)he wishes to search on, and a date range. 
The number of posts extracted are set to 100 per default, but can be changed up to 500.
